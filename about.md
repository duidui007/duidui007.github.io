大家好，这是我的博客，我将在这里和大家分享学习笔记和新知识。.

## So Simple Theme is all about:

* Responsive templates. Looking good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* Gracefully degrading in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 9+ and all modern browsers.
* Minimal embellishments and subtle animations. 
* Readable typography to make your words shine.
* Support for large images to call out your favorite posts.
* Disqus comments if you choose to enable.
* Simple and clear permalink structure[^1].
* Tags for [Open Graph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/) and [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) for a better social sharing experience.
* Vanilla [custom 404 page]({{ site.url }}/404.html) to get you started.
* Stylesheets for Pygments and Coderay [syntax highlighting](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/articles/code-highlighting-post/) to make your code examples look snazzy.
* Simple search that overlays results based on post title.
* [Grunt build script]({{ site.url }}/theme-setup/index.html#theme-development) for easier theme development.
* [Sitemap](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/blob/master/sitemap.xml) for search engines
